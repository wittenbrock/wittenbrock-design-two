Robin is a talented developer from Belgium, and has been an active member of the Tailwind community for a long time. This is some fancy `inline code from javascript` If you're a Tailwind UI customer and have ever asked a question in the #react channel on our Discord server, there's a 90% chance he's the helpful person who answered your question. He even built a bookmarklet to help people convert Tailwind UI components to JSX!

Robin is a seriously experienced React developer, and is joining us to help spearhead the open-source renderless UI libraries we are working on that will be the foundation for official React and Vue (to start anyways) support in Tailwind UI.

We're super excited that he is finally starting with us today, and can't wait to watch his contributions enable people to build awesome UIs even faster and with more confidence. Welcome to the team dude!
